      <description>Introduction My first Pi-hole installation was a pain mostly due to self-inflicted issues. That said there are a few disjointed steps, and my lack of networking knowledge will necessitate a future reference to more a in-depth guide than what&amp;rsquo;s currently available. This post serves as self-documentation on what went wrong so that I (or others) can avoid problems in future installations.
Network issues After initial installation, I could not access the Pi-hole admin page nor the internet.</description>

      <description>EDIT: I&amp;rsquo;ve made several modifications to the original piece based on helpful comments from reddit users newworkaccount, iKnitYogurt, jprada, and ThisTimeIllSucceed on the thread here. View the original post in its full glory/shame on Github.
Like everyone else, when I first started using GNU/Linux I gravitated toward Ubuntu. While using Ubuntu, I sought to try other distributions and briefly used Fedora, Elementary OS, and Debian. With all of these distributions &amp;ndash; including Ubuntu &amp;ndash; I came across a very similar problem: having to manually add software repositories to get programs that were more up-to-date than the package manager&amp;rsquo;s defaults.</description>

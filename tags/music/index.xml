      <description>Through a series of Reddit posts/comments I stumbled upon Abhinav Tushar&amp;rsquo;s personal website where he explains the advantages of keeping a personal wiki versus a blog. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to recite them all here since you can easily find them directly at the source, but I think this post is well-suited for my inaugural wiki-style post. For a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to compile a list of music that listened to through grad school while working/writing/studying/programming in part to share this music with others but also to have this list to fall back on myself.</description>

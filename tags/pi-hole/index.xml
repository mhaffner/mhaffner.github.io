      <description>Introduction My first Pi-hole installation was a pain mostly due to self-inflicted issues. That said there are a few disjointed steps, and my lack of networking knowledge will necessitate a future reference to more a in-depth guide than what&amp;rsquo;s currently available. This post serves as self-documentation on what went wrong so that I (or others) can avoid problems in future installations.
Network issues After initial installation, I could not access the Pi-hole admin page nor the internet.</description>
